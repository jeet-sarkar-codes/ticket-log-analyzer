# Ticket Log Analyzer – Jeet Sarkar

This Python CLI tool scans mock system support logs and summarizes the number of ERROR, WARNING, and INFO messages. Designed for basic log analysis automation — useful in early-stage diagnostic scripting.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Standard library (`collections`, `file I/O`)
- GitHub for code visibility and version control

## ⚙️ Features
- Reads and parses `.txt` log files
- Counts and categorizes log levels
- Outputs a summary report to the console

## 📁 Project Files
- `log_analyzer.py` – Python script for log parsing
- `sample_logs.txt` – Example log input
- `README.md` – Documentation

## 📌 Notes
Part of my transition into backend scripting. Builds confidence in Python loops, string parsing, and basic automation logic.
